Developed as part of the EDU chain OC-I incubator where 22 projects were selected from high-impact developers <br/>
and Hackathon winners to be vetted for Milestone-based grants and Investor exposures to help grow the projects with dedicated <br/>
growth and product mentorship to test their product on 20M+ learners on EDU chain.
A host of AI agents working together to maximize content retention from the documents of your choice <br/>
by allowing you to chat with them, pointing out the important topics from the documents, and enabling you <br/>
to take dynamic quizzes from the topics of your choice from the documents. <br/>

Educational content creators can compile their resources and content in a document
and share it with <br />
other users by using the public upload functionality and share the chat room
link across various social media websites. <br />
Creators earn money every time other users unlock the quiz component from any of
their published documents. <br />
Creators can withdraw the collected amount any time they want from their profile
section. <br />
