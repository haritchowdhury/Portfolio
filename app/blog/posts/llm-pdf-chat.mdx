summary: "A host of AI agents working together to maximize content retention from the documents of your choice
by allowing you to chat with them, pointing out the important topics from the documents, and enabling you
to take dynamic quizzes from the topics of your choice from the documents.

Educational content creators can compile their resources and content in a document and share it with
other users by using the public upload functionality and share the chat room link across various social media websites. 
Creators earn money every time other users unlock the quiz component from any of their published documents. 
Creators can withdraw the collected amount any time they want from their profile section."
